      <h2 className="text-center md:text-left md:text-left mt-20 text-4xl font-semibold">My Journey</h2>
      <p className="text-center md:text-left mt-5">My journey into the tech world began in 2024 when I enrolled in a Web Development course at Le Wagon. During the bootcamp, I immersed myself in various programming tools and technologies, including Visual Studio Code, Git, Ruby, SQL with Active Record, and core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p className="text-center md:text-left mt-5">One of the highlights of the bootcamp was working on a team project where we developed FitBud, a web application that generates personalized workout plans for users. This project was a valuable learning experience and was deployed on Heroku, showcasing our ability to build and deploy a functional web application.</p>
      <p className="text-center md:text-left mt-5">Following the bootcamp, my coursemates and I leveraged our skills to create BitSpend, an expenses tracking application. We enter it into the Gemini API Developer Competition, which provided an opportunity to apply our knowledge in a competitive setting.</p>
      <p className="text-center md:text-left mt-5">Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning advanced technologies such as React.js and Next.js. My goal is to continue growing and mastering new tools that will propel my career forward.</p>
      <p className="text-center md:text-left mt-5 mb-20">Although my journey in tech is just beginning, I’m excited by how much I’ve learned and am eager to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.</p>
